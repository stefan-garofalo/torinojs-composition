# Wiki Schema

This file defines how any agent operates within `wiki/`. Read it before creating or modifying wiki content.

## Skill Routing

Primary skills here: `create-spec`, `create-plan`, `implement-spec`, `simplify`.

- Phase skills such as `docs-ingest-phase` are global orchestration entrypoints, not scoped primary skills. Invoke them from the parent goal/handoff flow when needed; do not list them in scoped `AGENTS.md` primary-skill lines.
- Use `create-plan` to turn an approved spec into an execution-ready `PLAN.md`.
- Use `implement-spec` to execute an approved spec folder. Choose the execution mode inside the skill: `sequential` or `parallel`.
- Write canonical project operations under `content/docs/project/`.
- Keep `content/docs/project/` as the default scaffolded route tree. Product/domain routes belong to the individual project and should be added only when the repo deliberately defines them.
- Keep project-owned domain source indexes under `content/docs/project/domains/` when the repo defines routed domain surfaces.
- Do not create or maintain a separate `domains/` article tree.
- `SPEC.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION-NOTES.md` remain source material, but the ingest orchestrator may update their frontmatter/link bookkeeping (`ingested`, `last_ingested`, backlinks) as part of the pipeline.

## Directory Conventions

### `content/docs/project/` — Project Operations

Canonical routed pages for internal project operations: specs, plans, implementation notes, maintenance logs, decisions, repo guidance, and runbooks.

### `raw/` — Immutable Sources

Human-authored source material. Agent reads but **never edits**.

- `meetings/` — meeting notes, transcripts
- `external/` — external docs, reference material
- `assets/` — binary files, images, PDFs

### `specs/` — Feature Specifications

PM-authored specifications organized by domain. Agents should treat their product intent as source material and should not rewrite requirements casually, but the ingest orchestrator may update frontmatter/link bookkeeping when processing them into domain knowledge.

- `specs/CONSTITUTION.md` — repo-level implementation rules and sanity checks for spec-driven skills
- `specs/<domain>/<domain>-specs.md` — domain spec page map (entry point for discovery)
- `specs/<domain>/<spec-name>/SPEC.md` — individual spec file
- `specs/<domain>/<spec-name>/PLAN.md` — optional implementation plan for that spec
- `specs/<domain>/<spec-name>/IMPLEMENTATION-NOTES.md` — run-local reviewer context for that spec implementation; carries its own frontmatter and `ingested` tracking

## Frontmatter Schema

### Base (all wiki pages)

```yaml
---
domain: auth | user-management | documents
type: concept | flow | decision | contract | index | spec | implementation-notes
surface: wiki | project
permission: internal | project
links: []
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

### Spec-only addition

```yaml
status: draft | review | approved | implemented
```

`status` is required when `type: spec`, omitted for all others.

### Routed concept and flow pages

```yaml
ingested: true | false
last_ingested: YYYY-MM-DD | null
source:
  - specs/<domain>/<spec>/SPEC.md
```

Tracks whether the LLM has processed the page. Enables staleness queries.

### Implementation notes (`type: implementation-notes`)

```yaml
---
domain: <domain>
type: implementation-notes
spec: <spec-id> # e.g. CP-120
links:
  - "[[specs/<domain>/<spec>/SPEC]]" # always: own spec
  - "[[content/docs/<domain>/<flow-or-concept>]]" # added after routed pages are written
ingested: true | false
last_ingested: YYYY-MM-DD | null
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

`ingested: true` means the notes were processed by `$docs-ingest-phase` and their deviations/surprises are reflected in the domain flow and concept pages. Set only by the ingest orchestrator — never by hand.

### Raw files

```yaml
ingested: true | false
last_ingested: YYYY-MM-DD | null
```

## Ingest Workflow

When processing source material into routed domain knowledge:

1. Read source fully
2. Identify which domains it touches
3. For each domain: update or create routed flow pages first, then routed concept pages
4. Flag contradictions with `> [!warning] CONTRADICTS [[page]]`
5. Append entry to `log.md` (cap at 50 entries — drop oldest if over)
6. Update route `meta.json` files and root `index.md` if new pages created
7. Set `ingested: true` and `last_ingested` on processed source and created/updated pages, including `IMPLEMENTATION-NOTES.md` when present

## Cross-Domain Linking Rules

- Link routed pages with normal Markdown links or existing wiki link conventions used by the repo.
- A concept in one domain should link to related concepts in other domains.
- Backlinks from routed pages to source specs should point to `specs/domain/spec-name`.

## Lint Rules

- Orphan pages (no inbound links) = knowledge gaps
- Pages without frontmatter = malformed
- Stale pages (not updated in 30+ days after related ingest) = review needed
- Contradictions flagged but unresolved = action items

## Relationship to `docs/`

- `wiki/` owns business specs and domain contracts (the "what")
- `docs/` owns implemented architecture and reference (the "how it works now")
- `content/docs/project/tech-debt/<domain>/<spec>/<debt-slug>.md` owns persistent implementation drift tied to one spec; keep temporary execution notes in the spec folder instead
